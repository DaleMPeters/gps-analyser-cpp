gps-analyser-cpp
================

Program written in two languages that takes NMEA sentences from two different file streams, simulating a GPS receiver, and writes to a GPX file, a more accurate route.

Program was written for the purpose of understanding the differences between Java and C++.

Input files must be in NMEA format. An example of files that can be used can be found in the repository.
